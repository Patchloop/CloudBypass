## \~ What is CloudBypass?

CloudBypass is a private library I’ve developed over the past few months to consistently bypass modern web protection systems — especially Cloudflare.

It is capable of:

* Seamlessly passing Turnstile CAPTCHAs
* Bypassing JavaScript Challenges
* Mimicking human behavior for safe navigation
* Keeping sessions alive and undetected

🔒 This library is **private** and will **not** be distributed publicly or for free.

## \~ Who is this for?

This tool is intended for developers, researchers, and automation engineers who need reliable access to sites protected by Cloudflare. It’s perfect for:

* Web scraping behind Cloudflare walls
* Accessing APIs blocked by bot protection
* Maintaining stable automation flows
* Avoiding constant rewrites after updates
